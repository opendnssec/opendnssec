BASH completion script for OpenDNSSEC
=====================================
Copy the script to /etc/bash_completion.d/ to install. Restart bash or source 
the file on a running bash. The BASH shell will try to autocomplete commands 
and options for ods-enforcer and ods-signer.

The script is provided 'as is' and is not covered by our testing framework.
