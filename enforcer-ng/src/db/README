About
=====

This is a semi abstracted database layer meaning that the backend
implementations used by the layer and the objects using the layer actually know
a thing or two about each other. The layer is as abstract as it needs to be to
be able to support multiple backends that operates in completely different ways.

The basic idea is that you have database objects that represents the data model
of the database, these objects are used by the application logic and the object
them selves uses the database layer to describe them. The database layer is more
or less just a container for the description of the database objects and a
transporter for the information to the backend in use. The backend will perform
the operations coming from the database objects and deliver the result of them
using the classes of the database layer and that information will be interpreted
by the database objects and converted to be presentable as normal c value type
for the logic.

    |       Database Objects       |
    +------------------------------+

    +------------------------------+

Application - is the application/logic code that uses database objects to access
the data in the database.

Database Objects - encapsulate the data from the database using the database
layer and provides functions for accessing and modifying the data. There are
also function for retrieving object from the database based on fields and
related objects.

Database Layer - provides objects for encapsulating database values and for
describing database operations such as a clause list which contains a list of
fields, an operation and a value. CRUD operations can be executed through a
database connect to an underlying database backend.

Database Backends - executes the given operations according to how that specific
database backend handles data.


Object Revisions
================

All objects have a revision or something similar and when updating/deleting it
will use the revision to verify that the object has not been updated by anyone
else. If it has then the operation will fail with an error and the task that
performed the operation should be rerun immediately or rescheduled.
 

Backend Support
===============

SQLite     - supported and tested
MySQL      - wip
PostgreSQL - wip
CouchDB    - experimental support
LDAP       - wip
MongoDB    - wip


Object Descriptions
===================

db_configuration_t
  Object holding a configuration value as a key and value.

db_configuration_list_t
  A list of db_configuration_t, used for configuring database connection and
  backends.

db_connection_t
  Object holding a connection, used for connect/disconnect'ing to a backend and
  handling transactions.
  
db_object_field_t
  Object holding the definition of a database object field.
  
db_object_field_list_t
  A list of db_object_field_t, used for describing all the fields in a database
  object.
  
db_object_t
  Object holding the definition of a database object and used for create/read/
  update/delete the database object.
  
db_backend_handle_t
  Object holding functions to a database backend, used by db_backend_t.

db_backend_t
  Object holding a backend, used by db_connection_t.
  
db_join_t
  Object holding the definition of a join. SUBJECT FOR DEPRECATION!
  
db_join_list_t
  A list of db_join_t used to describe all joins in a query, used in read/update
  and delete. SUBJECT FOR DEPRECATION!
  
db_clause_t
  Object holding the definition of a clause.
  
db_clause_list_t
  A list of db_clause_t used to describe all the clauses in a query, used in
  read/update/delete.
  
db_result_t
  Object holding the result of a row from a query.
  
db_result_list_t
  A list of db_result_t, used to hold all the result from a query.
  
db_value_t
  Object holding a database value.
  
db_value_set_t
  Object holding a fixed set of database values.
  
db_type_t
  An enum describing all the different database value types.


TODO
====
- Maybe remove clause for update/delete and set object id in db_object_t
- Extend db value. Add const backend meta data list. Use in clause for update and delete.
- Extend object with db value for id and use that in update/delete if no clause list is given.
- Create templates for setting objects by foreign key.
