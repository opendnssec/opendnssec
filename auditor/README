Introduction
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The KASP Auditor checks the output of the signer against the
policy used to sign the zone (obtained from the KASP). The signer
calls the auditor once the zone(s) have been signed.

The auditor runs in two stages : first, the signed and unsigned
zones are sorted into canonical order, and then the sorted files
are audited.

Upon completion, the auditor signals any errors to the caller.
Errors and warnings are written to the configured log facility.

Checks performed include : DNSKEY, NSEC(3), RRSIG and NSEC3PARAM
checks. More details are available on the OpenDNSSEC website :
http://www.opendnssec.org

Dependencies
-------------------------------------------------------------------

To run the auditor, it is necessary to install dnsruby. It is 
presumed that Ruby is already installed on the target system, and 
that the system is online. To install dnsruby, run the following
 command : 

    gem install dnsruby

Ruby gems will download the dnsruby gem from rubyforge.org and 
install it to the target system. Depending on how Ruby is 
installed on the target system, it may be necessary to run the
above command as root.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Installation
-------------------------------------------------------------------

From the base directory <opendnssec>/signer :

autoreconf --install
./configure
make
make install

--prefix=<dir>    Installation directory. All files will be installed
                  relative to this path, and default search paths will
                  be relative to the prefix. Defaults to /usr/local


The auditor invocation script, will be installed in
<prefix>/bin
The Ruby libraries will be installed in
<prefix>/lib/opendnssec

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Testing
-------------------------------------------------------------------

To run the auditor test files, run the command :

  ruby test/auditor_test.rb

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Running Manually
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Although the auditor is designed to be run by the signer, it
can also be run manually :

kasp_auditor <path_to_opendnssec> [<zone1> <zone2>...]

e.g. kasp_auditor /etc/opendnssec/ example.com
