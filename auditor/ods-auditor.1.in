.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.LP
ods\-auditor is a module which provides auditing capabilities to OpenDNSSEC.

Once an unsigned zone has been signed, this module can be used to check
that the signing process has run successfully. It checks that no data
has been lost (or non\-DNSSEC data added), and that all the DNSSEC
records are correct. It uses the OpenDNSSEC standard logging (defined
in /etc/opendnssec/conf.xml).

The Auditor takes the signed and unsigned zones and compares them. It
first parses both files, and creates transient files which are then
sorted into canonical order. These files are then processed by the
Auditor. If processing an NSEC3\-signed file, the Auditor will create
additional temporary files, which are processed after the main
auditing run.
