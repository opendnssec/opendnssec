This file gives you instructions on how to migrate from one version of
OpenDNSSEC to another.


*** Migrating from v1.1 to v1.2 ***

  There is a kasp schema change from the 1.1 branch (or trunk if you built
  prior to r3823). To make this transition you have 2 options:

  1) Run ods-ksmutil setup again. This will remove _all_ the current
  information from the kasp database and start you off again with a fresh
  environment.

  If that is not an option, or you want to try something else then:

  2) run one of the migration scripts
        enforcer/utils/migrate_keyshare_mysql.pl
  or
        enforcer/utils/migrate_keyshare_sqlite3.pl
  depending on your database.

  NOTE: Although these scripts have been tested it is recommended to make a
        backup of your database prior to running them.




*** Migrating to a larger keypairs(id) field (MySQL ONLY) ***

  The version of the MySQL database that was created with v1.2 (and prior to
  svn r4465) had a smallint datatype for the keypairs(id) field. This limits
  the number of keys that the system can store to 32767.

  If this number is not large enough then the script:

  enforcer/utils/migrate_id_mysql.pl

  will increase it to an int, which can store 2147483647 keys.

  NOTES: Although this scripts have been tested it is recommended to make a
         backup of your database prior to running them.

		 This issue only applies to MySQL backends.
