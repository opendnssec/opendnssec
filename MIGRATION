This file gives you instructions on how to migrate from one version of
OpenDNSSEC to another.


*** Migrating from v1.1 to v1.2 ***

  There is a kasp schema change from the 1.1 branch (or trunk if you built
  prior to r3823). To make this transition you have 2 options:

  1) Run ods-ksmutil setup again. This will remove _all_ the current
  information from the kasp database and start you off again with a fresh
  environment.

  If that is not an option, or you want to try something else then:

  2) run one of the migration scripts
        enforcer/utils/migrate_keyshare_mysql.pl
  or
        enforcer/utils/migrate_keyshare_sqlite3.pl
  depending on your database.

  NOTE: Although these scripts have been tested it is recommended to make a
        backup of your database prior to running them.
