.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.LP
.I ods-ksmutil
manages the operation of the KASP Enforcer, which is the part of OpenDNSSEC
that triggers key generation and signing operations on domains based on
policies with user-defined timing and security requirements.
Since everything beyond this management utility is usually automatic,
.I ods-ksmutil
is the primary tool for managing OpenDNSSEC.  Among the functions of
.I ods-ksmutil
are key management, updates to the zone list and manually rolling keys
to recover from exceptional situations like key loss.
.PP
To get started, a first invocation of
.I ods-ksmutil setup
is needed;
see SETUP AND UPDATE COMMANDS below for details.
After this is done, the rest of the functionality of
.I ods-ksmutil
becomes available.
.PP
The following sections discuss the subcommands in logical groups,
detailing any options that they support.
.SH "GENERIC OPTIONS"
.LP
.TP
.B -c \fIconfigfile\fB, \-\-config \fIconfigfile\fB
Change the conf.xml file that is used from the default.
.TP
.B help
This can be used as a subcommand to
.I ods-ksmutil
or it can be used after a partial subcommand.  In response,
.I ods-ksmutil
will give a synopsis of how to continue the command.
.SH "SETUP AND UPDATE SUBCOMMANDS"
.LP
.TP
.B setup
Import conf.xml, kasp.xml and zonelist.xml into a database.
This deletes any current management information from the database
with OpenDNSSEC management information, including any references to
keys.  Updates to an existing setup should therefore not normally
run this subcommand, but
.B update
instead.
.TP
.B update kasp
.TP
.B update zonelist
.TP
.B update conf
.TP
.B update all
Update the database with the contents of the respecive configuration
file, or all those files.  The result is comparable to the
.B setup
subcommand, except that management information about OpenDNSSEC is
not deleted.
.SH "ZONE MANAGEMENT SUBCOMMANDS"
.LP
.TP
.B zone add \-\-zone|\-z \fIzone\fB [--policy|-p \fIname\fB] [--input|-i \fIinput\fB] [--output|-o \fIoutput\fB]
Add a zone to both zonelist.xml and the database.  This is equivalent to
manually editing zonelist.xml and then running the
.B update zonelist
subcommand.
The \-\-zone option names the zone to add; the \-\-policy option names
the policy to use instead of default; the \-\-input option specifies a
non-standard location for the unsigned zone (default is 
@OPENDNSSEC_STATE_DIR@/unsigned/ZONE); the \-\-output option specifies a non-standard 
location for the signed zone (default is @OPENDNSSEC_STATE_DIR@/signed/ZONE).
.TP
.B zone delete --zone|-z \fIname\fB
.TP
.B zone delete --all|-a
Delete one zone (or all zones, respectively) from both zonelist.xml and
the database.  This is equivalent to manually editing zonelist.xml and then
running the
.B update zonelist
subcommand.
.TP
.B zone list
List zones from the zonelist.xml.
TODO:Not from the database?
.SH "KEY MANAGEMENT SUBCOMMANDS"
.LP
.TP
.B key generate \-\-policy|\-p \fIname\fB --interval|-n \fIinterval\fB
Create enough keys for the named policy to last for the period of time given
by interval.  See INTERVAL FORMAT for the format of timing specifications.

If configured to, OpenDNSSEC will automatically create keys when the need 
arises.  This command can be used to pregenerate keys (maybe for the expected 
lifetime of an HSM) to help with backup policies.  It is also a convenient 
method of pregenerating a set of keys to allow a disaster recovery site to have
a copy of the keys without needed to synchronise keys generated on the fly.
.TP
.B key import \-\-algorithm|\-g \fIalgname\fB \-\-bits|\-b \fIbits\fB \-\-repository|\-r \fIrepo\fB \-\-cka_id|\-k \fIckaid\fB \-\-zone|\-z \fIzone\fB \-\-keytype|\-t \fItype\fB \-\-keystate|\-e \fIstate\fB \-\-time|\-w \fItime\fB [\-\-retire|\-y \fItime\fB]
Add a key which was created outside of the OpenDNSSEC code into the database.
In doing so, the further details involved in key management must be specified
in options.

The \-\-algorithm option names the algorithm used with this key; the \-\-bits
specifies the strength of this algorithm as a key size in bits.

The \-\-repository option names the repository in which the key should
be stored; the \-\-cka_id option specifies the name that will be used to
identify this key in that repository; the \-\-zone option specifies the zone
for which this key is to be used; the \-\-keytype option specifies whether
this key should serve as a KSK or a ZSK.  See KEY TYPES below for an
introduction to these terms.

The \-\-keystate option specifies the state in which the key will be after
import, and must be one of the options defined in the KEY STATES section below.
the \-\-time option specifies the time that this key was created;
the \-\-retire option specifies the time that this key should be retired. These last two options take the formats given in the TIME FORMATS section below.
.TP
.B key export \-\-zone|\-z \fIname\fB [\-\-keystate|\-e \fIstate\fB] [\-\-keytype|\-t \fItype\fB] [\-\-ds]
.TP
.B key export \-\-all [\-\-keystate|\-e \fIstate\fB] [\-\-keytype|\-t \fItype\fB] [\-\-ds]
Export the keys for a particular zone, or for all zones respectively, from
the database.  The \-\-ds option can be used to retrieve DS records for
upload to a registry instead of the full key; the \-\-keystate option can be
used to limit the output to keys in a given state; the \-\-keytype option
can be used to limit the output to keys of a given type.  See the
.I KEY TYPES and KEY STATES sections below for a specification of possible 
key types and states.
.TP
.B key list \-\-zone name [\-\-verbose]
.TP
.B key list \-\-all [\-\-verbose]
List information about keys in a particular zone, or all zones, respectively.
The \-\-verbose option is used to list additional information about each
key.
.TP
.B key purge \-\-zone|\-z \fIname\fB
.TP
.B key purge \-\-policy|\-p \fIname\fB
Remove any keys in the Dead state from the repository and from the
database of the KASP Enforcer.  The options \-\-zone and \-\-policy
are used to limit this operation to a single named zone or policy,
respectively.
.TP
.B key rollover \-\-zone|\-z \fIname\fB [\-\-keytype \fItype\fB]
.TP
.B key rollover \-\-policy|\-p \fIname\fB [\-\-keytype \fItype\fB]
Rollover active keys on the named zone or policy, respectively.
This command is used to intiate manual rollovers; if it is not given,
OpenDNSSEC will automatically rollover keys when the need arises. (Or, in the 
case of KSKs it will start the rollover process, to finish the KSK rollover see
ksk-roll below.)

The \-\-keytype option specifies the type of key to roll (both are rolled if nothing is specified) After running, the KASP Enforcer will be woken up so that the signer can be sent the new information.

If the policy that the zone is on specifies that keys are shared then all zones on that policy will be rolled. If appropriate, a backup of the sqlite DB file is made.

If there are no keys ready to take over from the current key then the rollover will not occur immediately, but will be put off until the is a key in the ready state.

.TP
.B key ksk-retire --zone|-z \fIzone\fB
.TP
.B key ksk-retire --keytag|-x \fIkeytag\fB
.TP
.B key ksk-retire --cka_id|-k \fIckaid\fB
Indicate to OpenDNSSEC that a currently active key should be retired.
If key identifiers are not provided then the oldest key in the zone 
will be retired.

If only one key is in the active state then this command will exit 
with an error message, as completing would leave no active keys.

.TP
.B key ds-seen --keytag|-x \fIkeytag\fB
.TP
.B key ds-seen --cka_id|-k \fIckaid\fB
Indicate to OpenDNSSEC that a submitted DS record has appeared in the
parent zone, and thereby trigger the completion of a KSK rollover.
Note that this action is not yet standardised, and can therefore not
be solved in a generic, automatic way.  This command was designed for
inclusion in any personalised setup that may or may not be automated.

There are several ways to specify which DS is in DNS, and the options
reflect these alternatives.  The \-\-keytag option specifies the
short integer that serves as a DNSSEC handle to a key; the \-\-cka_id
option refers to a key by way of its long hexadecimal identifier used
to identify the key in the repository.

An optional \-\-no\-retire flag can also be passed in, without this the 
existing key is moved into the retired state at the same time as making 
the new key active. If you wish to delay this step then pass in this flag 
and use the ksk\-retire command when needed.
.br
.TP
.B ods-ksmutil rollover list
List the expected dates and times of upcoming rollovers.  This can be
used to get an idea of upcoming work, such as the non-standardised
submission of DS records to a registry.
.SH "POLICY ADMINISTRATION SUBCOMMANDS"
.LP
.TP
.B policy export [--policy|--all|-p|-a]
Export a policy from the database in the same format as the kasp.xml file.
.SH "REPOSITORY AND BACKUP SUBCOMMANDS"
.LP
.TP
.B repository list
List repositories from the database.
.TP
.B backup list \-\-repository|\-r name
List the backups that have been made on the given repository.
The \-\-repository option specifies what repository to list.
.TP
.B backup done \-\-repository|\-r name
Indicate that a backup of the given repository has been done, all non-backed up keys will now be marked as backed up.
The \-\-repository option specifies what repository to list.
This is a necessary step for repositories that have the RequireBackup flag set.

Note that the KASP Enforcer may take the initiative to generate keys after
the backup has started and before the backup is done.  In the current version
of OpenDNSSEC, it is therefore needed to stop the KASP Enforcer to be assured
that all keys are backed up.  The sequence would therefore be:
.br
1. Issue \fBods-control ksm stop\fR
.br
2. Make a backup of the repository
.br
3. Issue \fBods-ksmutil backup done\fR
.br
4. Issue \fBods-control ksm start\fR
.TP
.B database backup [\-\-output|\-o output]
Make a copy of the database of the KASP Enforcer (if using sqlite).
This command ensures that
the database is in a consistent state by taking a lock out first.  The
\-\-output option specifies where the output should go; if not specified,
the output goes to the usual enforcer.db.backup file.
.SH "KEY STATES"
.LP
.TP
GENERATED
The key has just been generated, but is not ready for use.
.TP
PUBLISHED
The key has been published in the parent zone.
.TP
READY
The key is ready for use. E.g. according to settings in the policy the key has been published for long enough to have propagated to all resolvers.
.TP
ACTIVE
The key is actively being used to sign one or more zones.
.TP
RETIRED
The key has either reached the end of its scheduled life, or it has been rolled prematurely. However, records signed with it may still be cached sp the key is still being published.
.TP
DEAD
The key has been retired for long enough that its use is no longer cached, so it has been removed from the zone.
.SH "KEY TYPES"
.LP
Keys can be of two types: KSK or ZSK.  These terms are explained in more
detail in opendnssec(1).

In DNS records, the KSK can usually be recognised by having its SEP
(Secure Entry Point) flag set.  But please note that officially this is
a mere hint.
.SH "INTERVAL FORMAT"
.LP
When specifying an interval for a key generation run the ISO 8601 standard is used, e.g. P2Y6M for 2 years and 6 months; or PT12H30M for 12 hours and 30 minutes. Note that a year is assumed to be 365 days and a month is assumed to be 31 days.
.SH "TIME FORMATS"
.LP
When specifying a generation/retire time for a key being imported the following formats are understood:
.TP
YYYYMMDD[HH[MM[SS]]]
(all numeric)
.TP
D-MMM-YYYY[:| ]HH[:MM[:SS]]
.TP
DD-MMM-YYYY[:| ]HH[:MM[:SS]]
.TP
YYYY-MMM-DD[:| ]HH[:MM[:SS]]
(alphabetic month)
.TP
D-MM-YYYY[:| ]HH[:MM[:SS]]
.TP
DD-MM-YYYY[:| ]HH[:MM[:SS]]
.TP
YYYY-MM-DD[:| ]HH[:MM[:SS]]
(numeric month)
