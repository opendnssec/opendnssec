/**
 * Tasks.
 * Tasks consists of 3 parts: an identifier, due_date, and payload.
 *
 * Identifier: a task is uniquely identified by its ttuple (task-tuple).
 * which consist of a class (enforcer/signer) a type (resalt/sign) and
 * an owner, usually the zone the task is for. This way we can find
 * all tasks belonging to a component so we can later merge signer and
 * enforcer if we so wish.
 *
 * due_date: The time this task should run on. Unix timestamp. Anything
 * smaller than now() should be considered ASAP. Negative values should
 * not be given. They are special and tell the signer not to schedule a
 * task.
 *
 * Payload: the callback, a context passed to the callback and method
 * to free the context.
 *
