********* Important changes to zonelist.xml in 2.0 ***************

In 2.0, the zonelist.xml file is no longer automatically updated when zones
are added or deleted  via the command line by using the 'ods-enforcer zone add'
command. However, in 2.0 it is possible to force an update of the zonelist.xml
file by using the new 'xml' flag. This is in contrast to the behaviour in 1.4
where zonelist.xml was always updated, unless the 'no-xml' flag was used. 

As a result in 2.0 the contents of the enforcer database should be considered
the 'master' for the list of currently configured zones, not the zonelist.xml
file as the file can easily become out of sync with the database.

The contents of the database can be listed using:
  ods-enforcer zone list
and exported using the command
  ods-enforcer zonelist export
The contents of the database can still be updated in bulk from the zonelist.xml
file by using the command:
  ods-enforcer zonelist import    (or ods-enforcer update zonelist)
