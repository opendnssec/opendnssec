OpenDNSSEC 1.4.11 - Skipped

OpenDNSSEC 1.4.10 - 2016-05-02

Fixes::
* SUPPORT-156 OPENDNSSEC-771: Multiple NSEC3PARAM records in signed zone.
  After a resalt the signer would fail to remove the old NSEC3PARAM RR until
  a manual resign or incoming transfer.
  Old NSEC3PARAMS are removed when inserting a new record, even if they
  look the same.
* OPENDNSSEC-725: Signer did not properly handle new update while still
  distributing notifies to slaves.  An AXFR disconnect looked not to
  be handled gracefully.
* SUPPORT-171: Signer would sometimes hit an assertion using DNS output 
  adapter when .ixfr was missing or corrupt but .backup file available.
* Above two issues also in part addresses problems with seemingly corrected
  backup files (SOA serial).  Also an crash on badly configured DNS output
  adapters is averted.
* The signer daemon will now refuse to start when failed to open a listen
  socket for DNS handling.
* OPENDNSSEC-478 OPENDNSSEC-750 OPENDNSSEC-581 OPENDNSSEC-582 SUPPORT-88:
  Segmentation fault in signer daemon when opening and closing hsm multiple
  times.  Also addresses other concurrency access by avoiding a common
  context to the HSM (a.k.a. NULL context).
* OPENDNSSEC-798: Improper use of key handles across hsm reopen, causing
  keys not to be available after a re-open.
* SUPPORT-186: IXFR disregards TTL changes, when only TTL of an RR is changed.
  TTL changes should be treated like any other changes to records.
* When OpenDNSSEC now overrides a TTL value, this is now reported in the log
  files.

OpenDNSSEC 1.4.9 - 2016-01-21

Bugfixes:
* Add TCP waiting queue. Fix signer getting 'stuck' when adding many zones
  at once. Thanks to Havard Eidnes to bringing this to our attention.
* OPENDNSSEC-723: received SOA serial reported as on disk.
* Fix potential locking issue on SOA serial.
* Crash on shutdown. At all times join xfr and dns handler threads.
* Make handling of notifies more consistent. Previous implementation would
  bounce between code paths.

Known Issues:
* When using SoftHSM2 compiled with OpenSSL, and libmysql with OpenSSL as 
  database backend for OpenDNSSEC. "ods-ksmutil key list --verbose" crashes 
  on exit. This is ultimately a bug in OpenSSL and not new for this particular 
  release. Make sure you don't use this specific combination.

OpenDNSSEC 1.4.8 - 2015-09-24

* Support for RFC5011 style KSK rollovers. KSK section in the KASP now 
  accepts <RFC5011/> element.
* Enforcer: New repository option <AllowExtraction/> allows to generate keys
  with CKA_EXTRACTABLE attribute set to TRUE so keys can be wrapped
  and extracted from HSM.

Bugfixes:
* SUPPORT-145: EOF handling an ARM architecture caused signer to hang.

  signer, and <SocketFile> for the signer.
* New tool: ods-getconf: to retrieve a configuration value from conf.xml
  given an expression.

Bugfixes:
* OPENDNSSEC-469: ods-ksmutil: 'zone add' command when zonelist.xml.backup
  can't be written zone is still added to database, solved it by checking the
  zonelist.xml.backup is writable before adding zones, and add error message
  when add zone failed.
* OPENDNSSEC-617: Signer Engine: Fix DNS Input Adapter to not reject zone
  the first time due to RFC 1982 serial arethmetic.
* OPENDNSSEC-619: memory leak when signer failed, solved it by add
  ldns_rr_free(signature) in libhsm.c

Note: This release is marked as a beta release (rather than rc3) due to 
OPENDNSSEC-387, which is a significant functional change compared to rc2. 

* OPENDNSSEC-387: Rollback of multi-threaded enforcer. Due to key allocation 
  issues the usefulness of the threaded enforcer is outweighed by the code

OpenDNSSEC 1.4.0b1 - 2012-09-06

* OPENDNSSEC-130: libhsm: The PIN is now optional in conf.xml. The PIN can be
  entered using "ods-hsmutil login" and is stored in shared memory. The daemons
  will not start until this has been done by the user.

* OPENDNSSEC-218: Signer Engine: Prevent endless loop in case the locators
  in the signer backup files and the HSM are out of sync.
* OPENDNSSEC-225: Fix problem with pid found when not existing.
* SUPPORT-21: HSM SCA 6000 in combination with OpenCryptoki can return RSA key
  material with leading zeroes. DNSSEC does not allow leading zeroes in key
  data. You are affected by this bug if your DNSKEY RDATA e.g. begins with
  "BAABA". Normal keys begin with e.g. "AwEAA". OpenDNSSEC will now sanitize
  incoming data before adding it to the DNSKEY. Do not upgrade to this version
  if you are affected by the bug. You first need to go unsigned, then do the
  upgrade, and finally sign your zone again. SoftHSM and other HSM:s will not
  produce data with leading zeroes and the bug will thus not affect you.

  fixed in the upcoming LDNS 1.6.4 release.
* Auditor: Some good NAPTR records may fail to verify with dnsruby-1.41.
  This will be fixed in a future dnsruby release.
* TXT RRs: Some TXT RRs with escape characters may fail to parse correctly 
  with dnsruby-1.41 and ldns 1.6.3. This is fixed in the upcoming releases.

* The auditor now tracks the SOA serial over time
* The auditor (dnsruby) supports RSA/SHA256 and RSA/SHA512

Bugfixes:
* The LDNS bug that affected SRV records has been fixed in ldns-trunk.
* Bugreport #41: Fix for SOA serial 'keep'.
* Allow for SOA Serial/TTL/Minimum values of zero.
* Correct socket binding of NotifyListen.
* Systems with older SQLite had problem rolling keys on a policy.
* Auditor now handles SSHFP and NAPTR records correctly
  (but needs Dnsruby 1.39)
* Auditor now handles TTLs in zone file with suffix s, m, h, d, and w.


OpenDNSSEC 1.0.0b2 - 2009-10-09

* Added experimental support for RSA/SHA256 and RSA/SHA512 to KASP auditor.
  Dnsruby version 1.38 or higher required for SHA2 support.
* Added experimental support for RSA/SHA256 and RSA/SHA512 to KASP enforcer
  and the signer engine.
* SignerThreads and KeygenInterval has been deprecated (actually removed
  just before 1.0.0b1).
* Added support for RSA/SHA256 and RSA/SHA512 to libhsm. No API changes.

Bugfixes:
* Bugreport #33 (#35): Output a signed zone if only the SOA record changed. 
* Zone fetcher did not start correctly
* Create the pid / socket directory if it not yet exists, with the correct
  privileges.
* Signer Engine now catches exception if running with incorrect permission.
* TCP-support for LDNS on Solaris is fixed in LDNS trunk.

Known issues:
* LDNS is having problem with SRV records. The main effect is that these
  records are given non-valid RRSIGs. This is still under investigation.


OpenDNSSEC 1.0.0b1 - 2009-10-02

* <Purge> tag added to automatically delete keys that have been dead
  for some interval.
* Rename all OpenDNSSEC command line tools and daemons to ods-XXX (e.g.
  ksmutil becomes ods-ksmutil).
* kasp_check command added to check the conf.xml and kasp.xml configuration
  files for sanity and consistency.
* communicated and keygend combined to form "ods-enforcerd".
* ksmutil command line changes. Most commands have changed slightly, but
  there are some significant changes (see
  http://svn.opendnssec.org/docs/command-tools-syntax.txt for details.)
* Enforcer database now has a version number. If it differs from the version
  number in the code (specified via a #define statement), the software will
  issue an error message and not connect to the database.
* "ksmutil list keys" now displays the keytag if the -l flag is passed to it.
* "Emergency Keys" renamed to "Standby Keys" as this better reflects their
  role in OpenDNSSEC.
* The behaviour of SOA Serial value 'counter' has changed according to
  Ticket #31.
* The directory "xml" and been renamed to "conf". (This is part of repository
  clean.)
* There are changes to the KASP DB:
* Zone fetcher added, that will do AXFR from the master.

  If want to use your old database, use the following commands to upgrade:

    sqlite3 <PATH_TO_ENFORCER.DB> < enforcer/utils/migrate_090922_1.sqlite3
    sqlite3 <PATH_TO_ENFORCER.DB> < enforcer/utils/migrate_090930_1.sqlite3
    sqlite3 <PATH_TO_ENFORCER.DB> < enforcer/utils/migrate_091002_1.sqlite3

  Or, to start a new (with loss of information), remove old keys from the HSM
  and issue the command:

    ksmutil setup

Bugfixes:
* Make sure that parenthesis in zonefiles don't concatenate rdata fields.

Known issues:
* TCP-support for LDNS on Solaris is currently broken due to an issue with
  SO_RCVTIMEO. The result is that the zonefetcher doesn't work. No other
  parts of OpenDNSSEC is affected by this bug.
  There is currently no workaround.
