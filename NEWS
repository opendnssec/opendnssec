* Auditor: Configured zone SOA TTL now used to track pre-published keys,
  rather than the unsigned zone SOA TTL.
* Enforcer: There was a flaw in the implementation of the timing code (it 
  follows an earlier version of the draft and at one point does not add on 
  the safety margin).
* Enforcer: MySQL memory leaks fixed.
* Signer Engine: When changing policy or rollover a key, the old signed zone
  was not found,
  so always resulting in a fresh resign.

Bugfixes:
* Signer Engine: Signer processes could remain open, if they were not close 
  correctly.

  length). This problem is in LDNS 1.6.3 and previous versions. This bug is
  fixed in the upcoming LDNS 1.6.4 release.
* Auditor: Some good NAPTR records may fail to verify with dnsruby-1.41.
  This will be fixed in a future dnsruby release.
* TXT RRs: Some TXT RRs with escape characters may fail to parse correctly 
  with dnsruby-1.41 and ldns 1.6.3. This is fixed in the upcoming releases.

  is turned on.

* ods-ksmutil: update zonelist command now correctly adds and deletes zones (and
  sorts out their keys).

OpenDNSSEC 1.0.0b8 - 2009-11-23

  SQLite enforcer database.

Bugfixes:
* Auditor: Crashed on unknown RR class.
* Signer Engine: NSEC3 RR included wrong information in bitmap (fixed in ldns
  trunk).
* Signer Engine: Force a new signed zone if input is reread. Necessary because
  we cannot recognize if

* Signer Engine: Fix adding duplicate signatures in case of single key is
  being used as both ZSK and KSK.

  spaces.

OpenDNSSEC 1.0.0b4 - 2009-10-23

  and the signer engine.

OpenDNSSEC 1.0.0b1 - 2009-10-02

* <Purge> tag added to automatically delete keys that have been dead
  for some interval.
* Rename all OpenDNSSEC command line tools and daemons to ods-XXX (e.g.

  files for sanity and consistency.
* communicated and keygend combined to form "ods-enforcerd".

  there are some significant changes (see
  http://svn.opendnssec.org/docs/command-tools-syntax.txt for details.)
* Enforcer database now has a version number. If it differs from the version
  number in the code (specified via a #define statement), the software will
  issue an error message and not connect to the database.
* "ksmutil list keys" now displays the keytag if the -l flag is passed to it.
* "Emergency Keys" renamed to "Standby Keys" as this better reflects their
  role in OpenDNSSEC.
* The behaviour of SOA Serial value 'counter' has changed according to
  Ticket #31.
* The directory "xml" and been renamed to "conf". (This is part of repository
  clean.)
* There are changes to the KASP DB:
* Zone fetcher added, that will do AXFR from the master.

  If want to use your old database, use the following commands to upgrade:

    sqlite3 <PATH_TO_ENFORCER.DB> < enforcer/utils/migrate_090922_1.sqlite3
    sqlite3 <PATH_TO_ENFORCER.DB> < enforcer/utils/migrate_090930_1.sqlite3
    sqlite3 <PATH_TO_ENFORCER.DB> < enforcer/utils/migrate_091002_1.sqlite3

  Or, to start a new (with loss of information), remove old keys from the HSM
  and issue the command:

    ksmutil setup

Bugfixes:
* Make sure that parenthesis in zonefiles don't concatenate rdata fields.

Known issues:
* TCP-support for LDNS on Solaris is currently broken due to an issue with
  SO_RCVTIMEO. The result is that the zonefetcher doesn't work. No other
  parts of OpenDNSSEC is affected by this bug.
  There is currently no workaround.
