OpenDNSSEC 2.1.2 - 2017-08-03

* OPENDNSSEC-508: Tag <RolloverNotification> was not functioning correctly
* OPENDNSSEC-901: Enforcer would ignore <ManualKeyGeneration/> tag in conf.xml
* OPENDNSSEC-906: Tag <AllowExtraction> tag included from late 1.4 development
* OPENDNSSEC-894: repair configuration script to allow excluding the build of 
                  the enforcer.
* OPENDNSSEC-890: Mismatching TTLs in record sets would cause bogus signatures
                  Partial fix, note that mismatching TTLs is bad input
                  and should never been given.  Nevertheless OpenDNSSEC should
                  prevent problems, which in most cases will be the case now,
                  except when
* OPENDNSSEC-886: Improper time calculation on 32 bits machine causes purge
                  time to be skipped.
* OPENDNSSEC-904 / SUPPORT-216 autoconfigure fails to properly identify
                  functions in ssl library on certain distributions

OpenDNSSEC 2.0b1 - 2016-04-14

First public release of OpenDNSSEC.  Initial pre-releases have been
made to a smaller audience, this pre-release is explicitly made available
to all.  At this moment, there are no known functional bugs.  There are
naturally issues, especially to make working with OpenDNSSEC easier, however
none should prevent you to use OpenDNSSEC in production for the average
case, even though this is a pre-release.  Which is because of the still
limited documentation, and is not being run in production yet.

* The enforcer can no longer be run on a single policy at a time
  anymore.  An enforce run will always process all zones.
* The key generate method is at this time not available.
* The key export method will not allow you to export keys for all zones
  at once (--all flag) or for a particular type of key (--keystate).
  It will not export ZSK keys.
* The zonelist.xml in etc/opendnssec is no longer updated automatically,
  and by default works as if the --no-xml flag was specified.  Use
  --xml to the zone add command to update the zonelist.xml.  If updating
  the zonelist fails, the zone will still be added and not updated in
  the xml with future zone adds.
* Plugins directory renamed to contrib.
* Default signer working directory renamed from tmp to signer.
* Configure option --with-database-backend renamed --with-enforcer-database
* Zones on a manual rollover policy will not get a key assigned to them
  immediately.

  and <output> values for DNS adapters.
* OPENDNSSEC-454: ods-ksmutil: Add option for 'ods-ksmutil key import' to
  check if there is a matching key in the repository before import.
* OPENDNSSEC-281: Enforcer NG: Commandhandler sometimes unresponsive.
* OPENDNSSEC-276, Enforcer NG: HSM initialized after fork().
* OPENDNSSEC-330: Signer Engine: NSEC3PARAM TTL is default TTL again, to
  prevent bad caching effects on resolvers.
* OPENDNSSEC-428: Add option for 'ods-ksmutil key generate' to take 
  number of zones as a parameter

  fault when run directly on command line (i.e. not via interactive mode)
* OPENDNSSEC-440: 'ods-ksmutil key generate' and the enforcer can create
  too many keys if there are keys already available and the KSK and ZSK use
  same algorithm and length
* OPENDNSSEC-424: Signer Engine: Respond to SOA queries from file instead
  of memory. Makes response non-blocking.
* OPENDNSSEC-425 Change "hsmutil list" output so that the table header goes
  to stdout not stderr
* OPENDNSSEC-438: 'ods-ksmutil key generate' and the enforcer can create
  too many keys for <SharedKeys/> policies when KSK and ZSK use same
  algorithm and length

* Production release of 1.4
* Versioning scheme and release support policies updated
* Summary of changes in 1.4 can be found on the wiki:
  http://wiki.opendnssec.org/display/DOCS


OpenDNSSEC 1.4.0rc3 - 2013-03-15

* Further testing of OPENDNSSEC-387 completed, release returned to rc status.


OpenDNSSEC 1.4.0b3 - 2013-02-20

Note: This release is marked as a beta release (rather than rc3) due to 
OPENDNSSEC-387, which is a significant functional change compared to rc2. 

* OPENDNSSEC-387: Rollback of multi-threaded enforcer. Due to key allocation 
  issues the usefulness of the threaded enforcer is outweighed by the code
  complications. The option still remains in conf.xml for compatibility with
  existing use; but it will now be silently ignored.

Bugfixes:
* OPENDNSSEC-183: Enforcer: If no DNSKEYs use negative TTL as TTL(DNSKEY).
* OPENDNSSEC-185: Enforcer: Used wrong value for negative caching.
* OPENDNSSEC-206: Enforcer: Notify Signer on generating new signer
  configuration.
* OPENDNSSEC-224: Enforcer: Fix rolling simultaneous keys.
  (e.g. emergency roll)
* OPENDNSSEC-271: Enforcer: Signer configurations w/o keys are now accepted.
* Enforcer: Handle cases where negative cache > positive cache.
* Enforcer: Take resign interval into account when signer does smooth
  rollover.
* OPENDNSSEC-388: Signer Engine: Internal serial should take into account
  the inbound serial.
* SUPPORT-50/51: Signer Engine: Inbound DNS Adapter incorrectly updates 
  NSEC3PARAM and DNSKEY RRset [OPENDNSSEC-389]
* OPENDNSSEC-389: Input DNS Adapter incorrectly updating NSEC3PARAM and DNSKEY RRsets

Known Issues:
* Enforcer: Key material not always reused when using <SharedKeys>.
* Enforcer: Lacking documentation.
* Enforcer: No migration tools.


OpenDNSSEC EnforcerNG branch alpha2 - 2011-10-18

* Enforcer: Automatic introduce keys marked as manual, like other enforcer.
* Enforcer: Automatically retract never submitted DS records.
* Enforcer: CSK is now configurable.
* Enforcer: Do not allow lifetime of key to be shorter than TTL.
* Enforcer: Support for RollOverType in kasp.xml

Bugfixes:
* Enforcer: Fixed concurrency related crashes.
* Enforcer: Remove some scheduling when waiting for user input.
* Enforcer: Schedule the purging of keys.


OpenDNSSEC EnforcerNG branch alpha1 - 2011-09-23

HIGH-LEVEL DESIGN GOALS:
* Support for a large number of zones. The enforcer should reasonably be
  useable with many zones. Think order of magnitude 50.000 concurrent zones.
* Allow for future rollover strategies. Provide a generic framework to
  implement other kinds of rollovers in the future.
* Drop in replacement. Should replace the current enforcer but keep the same
  interface and provide migration scripts from earlier installs.

Trunk

Bugfixes:


OpenDNSSEC 1.4.0rc2 - 2013-01-25

* OPENDNSSEC-350: Signer Engine: Better log message when IXFR is not ready for
  reading.
* OPENDNSSEC-367: ods-ksmutil: Require user confirmation if the algorithm for
  a key is changed in a policy (as this rollover is not handled cleanly)

Bugfixes:
* SUPPORT-44: Signer Engine: Drop privileges after binding to socket
  [OPENDNSSEC-364].
* Signer Engine: XFR not ready should not be a fatal status for task read
  (thanks Ville Mattila).
* OPENDNSSEC-365: Enforcer: Nasty bug where KSKs could get prematurely retired.


OpenDNSSEC 1.4.0rc1 - 2013-01-10

* OPENDNSSEC-359: Remove eppclient

OpenDNSSEC 1.4.0b1 - 2012-09-06

* OPENDNSSEC-130: libhsm: The PIN is now optional in conf.xml. The PIN can be
  entered using "ods-hsmutil login" and is stored in shared memory. The daemons
  will not start until this has been done by the user.
* OPENDNSSEC-297: Enforcer: Multi-threaded option available for the enforcer to
  improve performance (MySQL only). 
* OPENDNSSEC-320: Signer Engine: The <ProvideTransfer>, <Notify>, <AllowNotify>

  as dead (rather than actually removing them). Leave the key removal to purge
  jobs.
* SUPPORT-29: Signer Engine: Fix ods-signer clear <zone> command exits
  prematurely [OPENDNSSEC-289].
* SUPPORT-30: Signer Engine: RRSIGs are left in the signed zone when
  authoritative RRsets become glue [OPENDNSSEC-282].

  Minimum change.
* OPENDNSSEC-253: Enforcer: Fix "ods-ksmutil zone delete --all"


OpenDNSSEC 1.3.7 - 2012-03-13

* OPENDNSSEC-215: Signer Engine: Always recover serial from backup,
  even if it is corrupted, preventing unnecessary serial decrementals.
* OPENDNSSEC-217: Enforcer: Tries to detect pidfile staleness, so that
  the daemon will start after a power failure.

Bugfixes:
* ods-hsmutil: Fixed a small memory leak when printing a DNSKEY.
* OPENDNSSEC-216: Signer Engine: Fix duplicate NSEC3PARAM bug.
* OPENDNSSEC-218: Signer Engine: Prevent endless loop in case the locators
  in the signer backup files and the HSM are out of sync.
* OPENDNSSEC-225: Fix problem with pid found when not existing.
* SUPPORT-21: HSM SCA 6000 in combination with OpenCryptoki can return RSA key
  material with leading zeroes. DNSSEC does not allow leading zeroes in key
  data. You are affected by this bug if your DNSKEY RDATA e.g. begins with
  "BAABA". Normal keys begin with e.g. "AwEAA". OpenDNSSEC will now sanitize
  incoming data before adding it to the DNSKEY. Do not upgrade to this version
  if you are affected by the bug. You first need to go unsigned, then do the
  upgrade, and finally sign your zone again. SoftHSM and other HSM:s will not
  produce data with leading zeroes and the bug will thus not affect you.

  for the pidfile at startup. If you want to run multiple instances then a
  different pidfile will need to be specified with the -P flag.
* ods-ksmutil: "zone delete" renames the signconf file; so that if the zone is
  put back the signer will not pick up the old file.

  fixed in the upcoming LDNS 1.6.4 release.
* Auditor: Some good NAPTR records may fail to verify with dnsruby-1.41.
  This will be fixed in a future dnsruby release.
* TXT RRs: Some TXT RRs with escape characters may fail to parse correctly

  value (was 3600).
* The signer engine will check if another engine is already running before
  starting.
* Startup scripts for Solaris (SMF).
* Auditor gives an error if key moves to "in use" without sufficient
  "prepublished" time.

Bugfixes:
* Trailing spaces are not part of the domain name/ include file/ ttl in
  directives.
* nsec3er: Print final RRset, even if no NSEC3 was needed at that RRset.
* Proper privileges dropping when creating the command socket
* Signer sometimes didn't terminate if socket shutdown failed.

Known issues:
* The Signer Engine fails with broken pipes sometimes.


OpenDNSSEC 1.0.0b3 - 2009-10-16

* The auditor now tracks the SOA serial over time
* The auditor (dnsruby) supports RSA/SHA256 and RSA/SHA512

Bugfixes:
* The LDNS bug that affected SRV records has been fixed in ldns-trunk.
* Bugreport #41: Fix for SOA serial 'keep'.
* Allow for SOA Serial/TTL/Minimum values of zero.
* Correct socket binding of NotifyListen.
* Systems with older SQLite had problem rolling keys on a policy.
* Auditor now handles SSHFP and NAPTR records correctly
  (but needs Dnsruby 1.39)
* Auditor now handles TTLs in zone file with suffix s, m, h, d, and w.


OpenDNSSEC 1.0.0b2 - 2009-10-09

* Added experimental support for RSA/SHA256 and RSA/SHA512 to KASP auditor.
  Dnsruby version 1.38 or higher required for SHA2 support.
* Added experimental support for RSA/SHA256 and RSA/SHA512 to KASP enforcer
  and the signer engine.
* SignerThreads and KeygenInterval has been deprecated (actually removed
  just before 1.0.0b1).
* Added support for RSA/SHA256 and RSA/SHA512 to libhsm. No API changes.

Bugfixes:
* Bugreport #33 (#35): Output a signed zone if only the SOA record changed. 
* Zone fetcher did not start correctly
* Create the pid / socket directory if it not yet exists, with the correct
  privileges.
* Signer Engine now catches exception if running with incorrect permission.
* TCP-support for LDNS on Solaris is fixed in LDNS trunk.

Known issues:
* LDNS is having problem with SRV records. The main effect is that these
  records are given non-valid RRSIGs. This is still under investigation.


OpenDNSSEC 1.0.0b1 - 2009-10-02

* <Purge> tag added to automatically delete keys that have been dead
  for some interval.
* Rename all OpenDNSSEC command line tools and daemons to ods-XXX (e.g.
  ksmutil becomes ods-ksmutil).
* kasp_check command added to check the conf.xml and kasp.xml configuration
  files for sanity and consistency.
* communicated and keygend combined to form "ods-enforcerd".
* ksmutil command line changes. Most commands have changed slightly, but
  there are some significant changes (see
  http://svn.opendnssec.org/docs/command-tools-syntax.txt for details.)
* Enforcer database now has a version number. If it differs from the version
  number in the code (specified via a #define statement), the software will
  issue an error message and not connect to the database.
* "ksmutil list keys" now displays the keytag if the -l flag is passed to it.
* "Emergency Keys" renamed to "Standby Keys" as this better reflects their
  role in OpenDNSSEC.
* The behaviour of SOA Serial value 'counter' has changed according to
  Ticket #31.
* The directory "xml" and been renamed to "conf". (This is part of repository
  clean.)
* There are changes to the KASP DB:
* Zone fetcher added, that will do AXFR from the master.

  If want to use your old database, use the following commands to upgrade:

    sqlite3 <PATH_TO_ENFORCER.DB> < enforcer/utils/migrate_090922_1.sqlite3
    sqlite3 <PATH_TO_ENFORCER.DB> < enforcer/utils/migrate_090930_1.sqlite3
    sqlite3 <PATH_TO_ENFORCER.DB> < enforcer/utils/migrate_091002_1.sqlite3

  Or, to start a new (with loss of information), remove old keys from the HSM
  and issue the command:

    ksmutil setup

Bugfixes:
* Make sure that parenthesis in zonefiles don't concatenate rdata fields.

Known issues:
* TCP-support for LDNS on Solaris is currently broken due to an issue with
  SO_RCVTIMEO. The result is that the zonefetcher doesn't work. No other
  parts of OpenDNSSEC is affected by this bug.
  There is currently no workaround.
